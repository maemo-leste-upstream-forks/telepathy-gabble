        <p>If true, the connection manager will automatically disclose the
          local user's capabilities (and hence the fact that they are online,
          but no further presence information) on request from any remote XMPP
          user.</p>

          <p>This is necessary to allow incoming calls from arbitrary

        <p>This property SHOULD also be available as a connection manager
          parameter, with the DBus_Property flag. The default SHOULD be false

    <signal name="DecloakRequested" tp:name-for-bindings="Decloak_Requested">
      <tp:docstring>
        Emitted when a remote contact asks for the local user's capabilities
        and basic presence to be disclosed.
      </tp:docstring>

      <arg name="Contact" type="u" tp:type="Contact_Handle">
        <tp:docstring>
          The contact asking for presence disclosure
        </tp:docstring>
      </arg>

      <arg name="Reason" type="s">
        <tp:docstring>
          A code indicating the reason that decloaking is requested, or the
          empty string if no reason code was given. As per the proto-XEP,
          well-known values are 'media' (remote contact wants to call local
          user), 'text' (remote contact wants to establish a text messaging
          session, perhaps end-to-end encrypted), and 'file' (remote contact
          wants to send the local user a file).

      <arg name="Decloaked" type="b">
        <tp:docstring>
          If true, the connection manager automatically disclosed the local user's
          capabilities and basic presence in response to the request, and this
          signal is merely for information. If false, presence was not
          automatically disclosed; a user interface MAY respond by calling
          <tp:member-ref>SendDirectedPresence</tp:member-ref>.
        </tp:docstring>
      </arg>
    </signal>

    <method name="SendDirectedPresence"
      tp:name-for-bindings="Send_Directed_Presence">
      <tp:docstring>
        Send directed presence to a contact. This MAY be called at any time,
        but will typically be used as a response to
        <tp:member-ref>DecloakRequested</tp:member-ref>
      </tp:docstring>

      <arg direction="in" name="Contact" type="u" tp:type="Contact_Handle">

          The contact to send directed presence to.

      </arg>

      <arg direction="in" name="Full" type="b">
        <tp:docstring>
          If true, full presence (status, message, avatar hash etc.) will be
          directed to the specified contact. If false, only capabilities and
          the fact that the user is online at all will be directed to the
          specified contact (the local user will appear to that contact as
          being in 'available' status).
