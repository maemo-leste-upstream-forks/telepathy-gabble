== Twisted tests ==

To run all Twisted tests:

  make check-twisted

To run an individual Twisted test:

  make -C tests/twisted check-twisted TWISTED_TESTS=test-connect.py

or:

  cd tests/twisted
  sh tools/with-session-bus.sh --config-file=tools/tmp-session-bus.conf \
        -- python test-connect.py

To run with debug information:

  make -C tests/twisted check-twisted TWISTED_TESTS=test-connect.py \
        CHECK_TWISTED_VERBOSE=1

or:

  cd tests/twisted
  sh tools/with-session-bus.sh --config-file=tools/tmp-session-bus.conf \
        -- python test-connect.py -v

To debug an individual test you can set one of the following env variable:

  * GABBLE_TEST_VALGRIND : to run Gabble inside valgrind. The report is
    added to tools/gabble-testing.log.

  * GABBLE_TEST_REFDBG : to run Gabble inside refdbg. The report is written
    to tools/refdbg.log.

  * GABBLE_WRAPPER="nemiver" : to run Gabble inside the graphical debugger nemiver.
    You'll be able to set up breakpoints; then hit the "continue" button to
    launch Gabble.
